Shelter is a blockchain-based system for storing and distributing humanitarian aid in a faster, low-cost, secure, and transparent way—**designed for recipients with basic phones, even in low-connectivity environments where no WiFi is required. Powered by Soroban smart contracts and the Stellar network.

## 🌍 What Is Shelter?

Shelter is a digital safe built on smart contracts, designed to securely hold aid that can be accessed by individuals in need. It serves displaced individuals, refugees, and vulnerable communities—providing them with agency and empowerment.

While Shelter was originally built for humanitarian aid disbursement—recognizing that people in crisis need not only physical shelter but also a secure place for their funds—its programmability makes it a flexible solution that can power a wide range of use cases: Lending Pools, Payroll Distribution, Disaster Relief, Anticipatory Aid, UBI and Social Assistance, Remittances, Education Grants, Event-Based Rewards, and more.

## 💡 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

- **Donors** send tokens (like USDC) directly to the Shelter.
- **Stewards / Admins** — trusted NGOs or community partners — manage the flow of aid: setting up who can access it, when, and how.
- **Recipients** (individuals in need) receive access through secure codes, phone interfaces, or other simple tools — no crypto knowledge required.
- **Shelter Smart Contract** — a transparent, programmable digital safe for holding and managing funds.

## 🌍 What Is Shelter?

Shelter is a digital safe place — built on smart contracts — where aid can be held and later accessed by people in need. It’s designed to serve displaced individuals, refugees, and vulnerable communities with fairness and care.

---

## 💡 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

- **Donors** send tokens (like USDC) directly to the Shelter.
- **Stewards** — trusted NGOs or community partners — manage the flow of aid: setting up who can access it, when, and how.
- **Recipients** (people in need) receive access through secure codes, phone interfaces, or other simple tools — no crypto knowledge required.
- **The smart contract is the Shelter** — a transparent, digital safe place that holds the aid and releases it fairly, based on clear, public rules.
